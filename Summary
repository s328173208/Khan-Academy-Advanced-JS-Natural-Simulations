The summary will respond to the following questions: How I will continue to use programming/computer science to continue to learn as a
student? What aspects of the module made the most significant impact on you as a student?

Natural Similations is making the animations look very natural instead of specifically telling it to move right, left, up, down, etc. This
is a bit different from Intro to JS because in Intro to JS, they teach you the basics of drawing simple figures and move them around like
something's being dragged on the canvas. But in Natural Similations otherwise known as Nature of Code, it looks more realistic. And the
code is more complex because you're telling the figures drawn on the canvas to move around naturally almost like real life. So this
requires a more code because it's clearly more complex. It is like a step up from Intro to JS.
